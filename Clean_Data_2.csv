BJP had millions of voters who as per congress are rakshas...we are happy with that and will continue to be with bjpÖ
27:33 Proud of our loving and patriotic leader of global leaders Shri Modi ji
Surjewala Called BJP voters Rakshas  then why  voters support to  Congress & it's alliance
Feeling very good to listen Ajay Alokji
Lagta hai all TMC people have lost their minds. As their such sick leader is not at all accepted and kicked out by rest of India.
"Media has been consistently underestimating BJP's numbers before every LS elections. If they are saying 288-314, imagine where it'll actually land."
Navika ma'am happy to see you .. 
The time has come when we stand with BJP and the rest family people have already united. So we need to be with the country as our silence can get many more ghotalas
l proudly say that Modi must becomes the 2024 election winning
MODIJI AGAIN 2024
"In Telangana, the advantage BJP had earlier has been lost. They only shouts against corruption but not done anything  to impress the public."

Donít worry NDA will get more then 400
As of today survey seems to be much realistic
Koi nahin hai Takkar mein ‚Ä¶. Total walk over for NM !

As a Hindu Only modi ji

"2 lac views in 3 days while comments below 500 and subscribers 55 lacs

Trust me I only watch navbhart time and time now one off my close working for information which side election going I spoke to him yesterday he say nda will win more then 385 plus the guy he is very honest guy

India doesn't want anymore Parivaar vaad politics Navikaji
2024 only PM Modi ji ?


"We need a strong and stable govt.  Modi and his central cabinet is strong and efficient- We have eminent leaders with vision like Nitin Gadkari, Jaishankar, Scindia, Rajnath Singh, and Amit Shah who have proven their worth. The opposition has a bunch of dynasts trying to loot and make money & run India like a family business!  Above all, a leader like Rahul Gandhi, 50 year ols youth leader,  who has not even led a panchayat!! lol! what are his credentials?   Why would India want to take a risk with an opposition like this when we have strong leadership at the center with Mr Modi."

"As a Bengali, at this moment anyone other than the TMC, whether it be bjp or congress or any other party who can defeat the TMC, I will support. I am fed up of corruption and violence in my state."
"The TMC representative is so correct when he says that WB voters are not concerned with GDP GROWTH RATE, Re Vs Dollar, New airports, railway station and trains, he is very correct because WB is actually counting on the number of cattle to be smuggled to Bangladesh, The amount of Sand to be stolen, number of jobs to be sold to unworthy people, how much coal is to be stolen, how much gold is to be smuggled in from Malaysia etc, etc. Modi Amit Shah are very poor players in these fields, hence the TMC spokesperson is absolutely correct,üëèüëèüëè"
"I'm from Kolkata, currently we need a change in policy, we need BJP let them say I'm a bhakt but it's my personal opinion"
"Once again, BJP Modiji will reign supreme in the country.
 BJP will get MP seats in all states with 350 seats and 45% vote sharing."
As a Delhi person I am sick of AAP and my vote is for Modi and I dont hear any person I know who is supporting the other parties
"As a resident of West Bengal, I am with full confidence stating that BJP will not win 18 to 20 seats. It will win atleast 25 seats from West Bengal. BJP will perform badly only in Muslim dominated seats like murshidabad, South Malda, South Dinajpur and couple of other Muslim dominated constituency. But BJP will perform extremely well in all Hindu dominated seats except may be Kolkata and nearby where it has cosmopolitan character. Original West Bengal Bengali Hindus popularly called Ghati Bengalis will overwhelmingly vote for BJP along with motua communities and others. So number of seats, BJP will win never less than 25 seats. This is my challange."
"With India poised to be the 3rd largest economy, a thumping majority for the BJP is essential. Besides, the Opposition have only been throwing spanners in India's determined endeavour towards it by undermining her capability. No Superpower to be needs anti-national elements."
"I don't think the BJP will fare that badly in Tamil Nadu since a lot of unsavory incidents have taken place since may which the electorate will forget so easily like mass corruption,  high electricity rates and high unemployment besides high inflation. The people will definitely view all these very seriously. The election is still several months away. Anything can happen then"
"West Bengal: my projections
- BJP: 28 /42
- TMC: 8 / 42
- Cong (2) + LF (1) + ISF (3): 6 / 42"
The spokesperson of TMC is more frustrated and depressed by seeing the survey. I am assuring him 3 Seats.
In Tamilnadu BJP & AIADMK combine will sweep 39/39 seats
"1st they opposed CAA by claiming that this law has DISCRIMINATION, now they are opposing UNIFORM civil code...matlab kuch bhi."
 unfortunate that the TMC is the most uncivilised party in the country.
Development and growth is clearly visible and rapid in BJP government
"In Tamil Nadu, the NDA will capture all the 39 seats. The DMK + Congress alliance will draw a blank.
The NDA will win 400+ out of 543 seats."
"In Karnataka people are quiet agitated the way in which Congress is implementing the promised guarantee schemes by draining the exchequer without any clear cut plan 
It will definitely hurt the prospects of Congress"
"In karnataka BJP will get atleast 22 to 24 seats in lokhsabha,  Modiji is still favorite in karnataka.  Congress have fooled karnataka peoples by false freebies"
"Whoever voted BJP last time  are not going to shift their loyalty in 2024. So, 300+ is assured."
The general perception is that the NDA will win fewer seats than the 353 seats it won in 2019. Despite winning fewer seats the perception is that the NDA will win the seats required to form the govt. This poll reflects this perception.
India needs Modi as PM . The best PM India has ever had. Now India is on progress under the able leadership of Modi ji
One and only Modi ji ....in Telangana too ..
"After Modi retired from politics
Yogi  shall take over  to lead this nation to the top of this world
At least 20 years he shall rule this nation"
"People can't digest the last 10 years stands of INDIA, still they are in darkness days........... Joy Hind"
Even if Modi vote share decreases Rahul Gandhi will still can never be the PM
In Tamil Nadu the popularity of the present ruling dispensation is losing steam due to maladministration and steep corruption.
BJP should make a hat-trick for the steady & visionary progress of the country.
Modiji has been working for the development of India since 2014 ...
"Unfortunately Opposition isn't as creditable as BJP. High time to reshuffle the Opposition leaders before even unity! At present of rapid growth required, coalition parties isn't a good idea!"
Survey has underestimated NDA in many states. Karnataka BJP 22 to 23. If allied with JDS then it will be 25 to 26. In TN DMK is reeling under severe anti Incumbency and many say that DMK front may not cross 10. Moreover the alliance is not yet finalised here in TN. Also in Telengana BRS unlikely to cross 10. BJP might pick up 7 to 8. Overall BJP alone might win 310 to 320 seats.NDA 340 to 350. Many states are fluid as far as the alliances are concerned.
"Modi ji has to prove to all
That he is going to get a big majority 3 rd time around too . 90% this will happen .  10% we can predict only 1 month before elections ."
"Vande bharath trains and National Highways ,BRO are fine examples of what they delivered, foreign diplomacy & Defence diplomacy, are quite appreciative, finance sector doin maximum with in limits and also performing above average  in current situation of  post covid and russia ukraine war. All india is need not to become another srilanka or pakistan. For that this govt need to continue with stability"
"Mumtaz bano gave  Rohingyas,  Bangladeshi ghuspetgias,  BOMB making industry in every home , still Bano won
Kauwa Ashutosh is so excited that BJP is losing 2024 but he will be greatly disappointed when the results come in 2024
Towards the end of this discussion non-BJP panelists have realized what  is there in store for them in 2024"
"This survey was conducted before the B. J. P + J. D, S alliance. If bjp and jds make alliance their vote share will be definitely more than 50 percent so the combination will cross 25 L. S seats. Simillarly in Maharashtra the split in N. C. P will reduce the U. P. A seat considerably and good increase in N. D. A seats. In Bihar J. D. S will become very weak close to election. Most of the 16 JDU m. Ps will not get accomodation due rjd , jdu, congress left alliance so most of jdu sitting M. Ps will join N. D. A alliance parties. In Punjab possibility of bjp akalidal alliance."
"These time tested corrupt opposition parties have a very dismal & pathetic track record of governance. In fact leaders of these corrupt opposition parties are jealous of the popularity of Modi ji & envy his stature as a global leader. Undoubtedly, Modi ji is the most hardworking, honest, visionary, nationalist & best PM since Independence & under his able leadership  BJP is going to win the 2024 LS election with a thumping majority !

"Parties May come and goes.. We the people of India want a  good Prime Minister that India needs  Liberty, Equality, and fraternity.."
My vote+ my friends vote 11 s goes to BJP BJP enter into tamilnadu thought Annamalai ji
"Padmaja is superb, her political knowledge is outstanding "
"I  am from TN and I can strongly say that the survey is rubbish. The mood of people in general is against the ruling party in the state with so many corruption and gooda charges. You have given 8 seats to Cong, which a joke by itself. DMK will not allot more than 5 seats to cong. I am not for BJP or any  others. But as a normal person, the mood is strongly against the DMK. I will not be surprised if the NDA gets more than 30 seats from TN.."
"She nailed it ""literally everyday Annamalai and Palaniswamy have got things to say about each other"""
Save our Motherland from recent happenings in South India
Entire India like MODI at Central Government
"In 2014 election Congress made a major mistake by ignoring the developing relationship between BJP  and the RSS , because  Congress leaders were so confident about them that they will win the election easily because they won most of the previous elections  This has costed them to lose the election."
"Modi has a vision to transform India
Other left wing parties busy in giving freebies. (I am studying Economics and my teacher said never vote for a leader who gives things at free of cost)"
"26:58 In Tamil Nadu loosing hope on DMK. So, getting 18 sheet is more difficult for them. They will try to spend money as much as possible to win sheet. even it's difficult. Also,  If DMK continue alliance with Congress, wining percentage will go less for them. 1 or 2 place NTK also will come, because of their manifesto also, majority of youngsters are with him.  Winning sheets by BJP will be more difficult, but they can capture 1 or 2 sheets, If they announced some good Income tax cut, reducing price of essential goods price,  they can win 3 to 4 sheets. Also, ADMK can win some sheets but if they didn't alliance with BJP."
"Modiji is surely going to get 324+ seats , but Congress as you have projected will not get that much seats it will end up roughly around 40 seats. You have to remember that out of 52 seats Congress got in 2019 was due to 7 seats in Tamilnadu and 15 seats in Kerala which will not be the case this time"
Very fantastic the DMK is not contesting that much number of seats as Times Now projected.
We don‚Äôt have a credible and honest opposition in India. BJP is the only option. My vote goes to Modi 3.0

I am very surprised that Congress will get so many seats. I think muslim women will support BJP this time.
"Equation in Maharashtra has changed dramatically yesterday & many more changes will take place in all the states in coming months. So it's too early to come in to any conclusion.
However, my humble request to  TMC people is that they should not talk about development, progress, economy & general well being of the people as these are not their prerogative.
Time is not far away, when the TMC wil be in oblivion."
Karnataka lost not due to inflation and unemployment . Karnataka has capacity to provide employment to others . Adminstration was good but politics played diffrently
"BJP Won 2024 Loksabha Election With Full Majority to form Cabinet at CENTRE leadership of Our Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji Sarkar Jai Hind Jai Shri Narendra Modiji Sarkar.

Really liked the giggle of Padmaja whenever opposition spokesperson was gvng nonsense response
Hindus must unite and vote for single party...
"WB - like UCC in Uttarakhand will bring Sharia. and the poll point in 2024 for Karnataka, Kerala and TN would also be the same going by the trend of Sidda Ramaiah and Stalin. Looks like that's what India wants as well according to Mr. Rehman on the show."
It's good survive. We Indian needed only welfare and good governance in center. We Indian don't need corruption people in central. Of course we  don't want rather than pm Modiji has pm for India. All opposition are courpted. Modiji is Modiji no one can match with  him .i am proud to be Indian under Modiji. Jai hind.
"30:43 exactly, state election is completely different from Loksabha election, we kannadigas might have elected congress because of Siddaramaiah leadership but we will never gone accept rahul Gandhi as our pm"
"Thank you sir. BJP must work hard. After capturing power, NRC and CAA must be implemented in WB first."
33:47 HUGE TURNING POINT IN TN POLITICS. The OTHERS that you mention is none other than NTK (Naam Tamilar Katchi - We the Tamils). They've been so silent in the past 8 years and now rocking the boat of ADMK and moving closer to DMK. Come 2026 if this trend continues TN will have the first Non Dravidian party CM in 60 years.
"In Tamil nadu, you may require to reasses the survey. BJPs Annamalai is taking the state to  stroms with all the poor performance of the ruling party. My assumption bjp may get more than 25."
"If you want to see Bharat as strong, secure and development in growth of the country then people needs to vote only to BJP."
We want solid Pm Modi again
We need a very strong determined leadership. And NAMO is the automatic choice of PM post.
NDA will get 375 to 400 seats as it will give unprecedented win to them .
"Some big Bills are coming in the next 6-8 months. Like UCC, NRC.

Ram Mandir inauguration in Jan 2024.

I think BJP alone will easily cross 305."
Ashutosh should learn to respect the constitutional authority.  Guvernor is not a spokes person like him.
In Tamilnadu you can see surprise...the BJP is gaining lot of momentum..
Tmc will loose badly if citizens allowed to vote without violence
I confirm my vote for BJP only 
"The nation in terms of development has started gathering speed under non-corrupt Modi ji, anyone with minimum common sense will vote for Modi, vote for Bharat."
"People must take a vow. 1. TMC must be defeated and vote only bjp. Do not believe Congress. 

2. Orissa patnaik is the best choice

3. Ensure that Congress to get only single digit along with opposition parties. 

4. All the bjp cadres must work for 500+ seats so that BJP cdn get 400+ seats. 

5. Overall , Congress and Opposition must be defeated. Otherwise, it will be dangerous."
Not surprised even BJP will get 420
For Indias growth and security BJP is the only hope. Please vote for BJP.
The survey was conducted in bjp office
V all pray for another MODI BJP Government with 405+ seats.  D rest will get splitting for others
"Let Mr. Modi win all the elections as per the mandate of the people of India.
 What really bothers me is that the news channels have stopped asking questions and are only concerned with Mr. Modi's electoral performance. Imagine your plumber strats doing the same with their job or your doctor or your driver.

News should come with a disclaimer."
There has been nothing wrong with the last 5 years rule..and so definitely with the NDA again this time
BJP has a vision and focus on achieving the promises the  ve made.
TMC spokesperson showed his level 
MY VOTE FOR NAMO..JAI HIND

BJP will get close to 305 seats individually

Can't stop laughing at your survey in AP 
Ashutosh is not a neutral political analyst he is basically a biased politician.
"BJP is the only party with long term vision... Other party had only target of achieving power at any cost... Vote for BJP and save India.. When your enemy cries of your regime, then you must understand that country is going in the right way.."
"From talking to many people, including members of the Meitei  Kuki communities, it was understood that the reason for the sudden outrage was the judgment of the Chief Justice of Manipur High Court that an immediate decision should be taken on giving reservation to the Meitei community. He does not know the situation here. He is an outsider. Hindus want to expel Kuki sects including Christians living in forest areas"
Need Modi in center for sure
I request media channels to arrange for a consent at national level through sms or missed call option from the viewers/common people on this issue to avoid and ignore the hue and cry among the parties.
"Irrespective of comments criticism   tantrums of opposition parties BJP should be in power for atleast another 30 years, minimum"

I love this anchor journalist speaking skills.
Bjp will win by greatest ever margine of their winning history
TMC spokesperson is seen crying like a school boy slapped hard by his PT sir.
"According to one of the speakers, this survey is a conspiracy! Shows what kind of mindset such people have."
Who are the foolish people who voting for the opposition party wake-up people and vote BJP.
Anytime BJP will win. They have made India and Indians proud. Whole world wants to join hands with India. No corruption. Only development for betterment of people.
Only Modiji 3.0
"It's time to think beyond Narendra Modi, BJP needs to rethink and reinvent right from now to have a better future for the country"
Plz indians vote modi BJP & save nation. Jai hind 
Alok Sir is right that BJP will increased  in TN. AP
Even Tamil Nadu will give BJP minimum 15-20 seats for Lok Sabha thanks to Annamalai
"As long as the  chief spokesperson Mr. Rahul Gandhi is there in the frontline, BJP win is inevitable"
"Modi govt must put effort to clarify the Wristlers protest and manipur condition and the people behind this propoganda some educated community can understand the idea and objectives behind those incident but uneducated who r only depending on half information telecasted on media not able to get the complete picture, opposition are using that as their brahmastra"
"Aiadmk has became weak due to infighting between Palanisamy  Panner selvam,Dinakaran and Sasikala .The Split is helping dmk though they are getting close to 32 to  33%.Admk need to enter seat sharing alliance  with Nam Tamilar Party of Seeman to fight Dmk. Bjp though growing in Tamilnadu will get a maximum of 10% vote share mainly due to Annamalai."
The oppositions think they are smart but voters will teach a lesson who is a really smart.
2024 will drive the Last Nail to Congress Coffin.
God is truth love peace unity justice Righteousness Holiness and Brotherhood Amen God hates bribery corruption wrongdoing wickedness bloodshed evil injustice lies pride Amen. God bless our Country India with a God fearing PM in 2024 Elections
BJP ..no doubt. I cannot see another face capable as a leader that can lead India to the top apart from Modiji
"Rahul has proved himself that just to get PM seat, he can insult India, its culture or History,. While Modi ji has proved himself as the best leader of the generation so far, in the entire world, the way he has managed Covid, Economy of india, as compared to rest of the world, so Modi ji definitely my next PM, while Rahul i wouldn't appoint him even as my dog's caretaker"

It is possible for the BJP to win all the 39 seats in TN only if the election commission conducts elections via social media.
My dream is to see BJP alone cross 450+seats with NDA taking 50+seats.

"As per constitution,  india is secular.  As per secular,  minority act,  waqf act unlimited extraordinary powers, AIMPLB  to be scrapped immediately"
Meaningless exercise to bring in politicians to analyse surveys. People have stopped believing surveys because of politicians in such debates. Even journalists take sides. So best is to discuss the surveys with those who did the survey and tell the listeners how they got to the figures and why.
How can someone buckle up to say that they can run the Nation by miserably failing in adminstration of their own States...may be they think that they just born in modi age or to a certain family is the eligibility to run the Nation...

Please get alert and remember your one vote is very precious and hence, vote very wisely.

Ashutosh is basically a frustrated Politician with unique combination as failed pollster.   Now it is waste of time to call him in such debate
survey does not have name and  id of people who enter  this survey as some might not be honest in doing the survey as we have a lot of people who does survey to make the statistic look beautiful but you need to minus 50% as some are fake survey-some might even enter survey 2 or  3 times to confuse the statistic -i think
"I couldn't stop laughing with 250 sample per parliament constituency, deciding the fake analysis speaks the untruth of the ground realities. Times Now should speak the truth. "
Did they show the Uttar Pradesh Numbers in this poll?
Tausif Rehuman says Airport's and High ways and the GDP growth etc doesn't exist actually.  What is the TMC for?  The HC  Kolkata just bashed the government of TMC for the election related issues.
"The present mood is like this

UPA - 150-170

The real point is how this arithmetic is going to change if a united opposition comes and stall division of votes."
my vote goes to great modi ji
The TMC guy is just a lunatic
Worst part is India is not affordable for a coalition government and it should have either Congress lead or BJP lead.  Regional parties will be like stray dogs fighting for coconuts
Coalition hatao desh bachao.... Modi in 2024
TMC fellow talking about country's Economy is a big joke
If opposition comes to power its will be doomsday for India...please vote for Modi
Once again we need Modi ji
350+ again. Most important UP missing in this survey 
Vote for Modi ji 
Modi ji wil come third term Simple calculation 90 percent of india is middle class lower middle class and poor and they will vote for chai walla not a rich family bachelor
Ashutosh is a senior journalist but biased & lives in dreams 
Jai ho Bharat jai ho BJP Jai ho Mr.Modiji
"Equation &, perception will change in favour of BJP in Jan, 2024 onwards. As entire Tukde-tukde gang of opposition will get exposed as their Freebies promises will back fire as it might be offered with many ifs & buts. So it will be limited to very few.
And thats the reason why BJP-NDA might cross 375+ Seats in 2024 Loksabha elections. 
Dekho aaghe aaghe hota hai kya. Bharat todo gang will certainly loose the Election.

Modi vs All.... it's gonna be fun
MODI JI Vishwa Guru we will see again on 2024 with aqbsolute majority rule
Once united opposition fail in up is not always happen again and again failure is the pilar of success
We need nda to gets more than 400+
Only Modiji in2024.
50% + Vote share is a winner in our country for that state
in Tamilnadu OTH is NTK... Growing Party by Youngsters...
If at any cost BJP loses means India gone
Good to see that backstabber Chandrababu is going to lose again in Andhra. Jagan is completely in favour of the poor. Hope he gets landslide victory again.
In Telangana BJP is ready to lose their diposits in 100+ seats out of 119 this December assembly elections Ç and coming to MP seats this time they lost deposits in all MP seats
Still there is no allegation of corruption against BJP even after 9 years of government.
2024 Modi Once More 
"Game of vote share :

BJP+ has 38% 
INC has 29%
Others got 33%

If we add others to congress as opposition is now united their vote share jumps to 62% which is overwhelming infront of BJP ... If only 200-250 seats get one-on-one infront of BJP, I'm speculating that BJP may limit itself in 180-220 ball park .. In that situation, if we give them 220 they'll need 50+ seats from allies which seemz very difficult right now .. Fingers crossed let's see ... ü§û"
In the world of MODI-BJP HATRED.. Rahul Gandhi with a message of LOVE &  PEACE...
Modiji will be the unanimous Prime Minister during 2024
modi sir..
"Now or 2024,Modiji has thumbs up!Electorate have no choice!"
This opinion poll is scary. Indians have to understand and vote for BJP to make India grow further . If congress comes back to power India will go back to dark ages.

"BJP- 284 seats alone.
NDA-  315-325 seats in total."
"Ashutosh should be out from this debate , as he is always against of bjp"
YSRCP got 9 Parliament seats in the year 2014.. You need to correct this in your slide.
All opposition will die or vanished
Why would anyone vote for Rahul Gandhi who goes abroad to insult India. Dump him.
"Phir ek baar modi sarkar
K'taka bjp will win 20+.."
Jai Hindu 
But BJP cannot take the election easily. Hope they don‚Äôt become complacent like in Katnataka
TMC's Tauseef shud admit that d Guv can't always remain nutrsl between d ruling party n d country as a whole. National interest shud always come abv everything else. He can't b a mere ornamental figure when nat'l interest is in jeopardy.
Modi 350+!!
ek modi sab pe bhari ... how true
"In Andhra Pradesh all 25 seats goes to NDA only , in Telangana 14 out of 17 seats goes to NDA .. in odisha also bjd will support to NDA all seats in odisha also coming under NDA"
"The best joke in this survey is that Ysrcp in Andhra Pradesh will win 25 mp seatsÇ, I am from Andhra here there is no situation like that. People purely oppose Jagan reddy in Andhra. Maybe he will not get 30% of the vote share"
How khangress getting 10-14 seats in karnataka can any can explain?
Oppsition partys may join but voters may not join.
Now itself its 325 and in 2014 when elections are held bjp will itself will get 330 to 350 seats and NDA will get 370 to 400 seats
Opposition is experiencing tremors.. nothing else. We People will dissolve opposition which takes hate as tool just for its hate for hate of bjp/Modi and  HAS NOTHIG TO DO WITH NATION PROGRESS OR SECURITY.
"Why  the members of a particular  religion  are turning  a blind eye to Indias phenomenal  development  under BJP. Surely they are blinded by their religion, which  is more important  to them."

"I'll challenge that BJP will win 400+ independently, coalition will breach 450!!"
Why pappu's photo is shown here. He is not an elected candidate and is now jobless.
Looks like congress will die forever. In fact it is Good for the country.
"Forget Rajasthan Chattisgarh, BJP can't win in these states"
The  results of TIMES NOW  SURVEY Is very much understandable becaue  for  obvious reasons people are not fools people have made up their minds to vote out BJP. The panelist do not the decide the election results
There is no mass leader in oppositions like Modi. So Modi has to be in 2024. Jai Bharat.
Karnataka results will reflect every where
They made parliament like coffin? Why?
Where is the survey of UP having the largest loksabha seats and uttarakhand 
In Maharashtra BJP hardly getting double digit.
One thing is pretty clear that the world will continue to be as usual
State politics and National politics are two different subjects. Indians are going to Vote for  a Strong govt. Only
In Election of 2024 - Sure Congress will get 150+ seats and it'sallies .. arround 100 ... sure that leads to BJP 's end in India  !
"I can never imagine pappu raul as our nations P.M....

All analyst understand karnataka doesnt renew state govt.and votes differently btwn vidhan sabha and loksabha.
"Please don't jump in the conclusion now.. people get more irritated or jeolusy or high chances for crime.
     All of you Prepare /wait and prayers."
Looks like someone woke up from his sleep and put these number out . BJP will cross 300+ on its own and NDA will cross 350+ if not 400.
What about Kerala?
As ap there is tight fight between ysrcp and tdp..
Tamilnadu mass leter seeman for ntk
Next 40 years bjp is major role in Indian politics
P.O.V - Ye bi Godi meda ha

"If times now is showing that BJP+ could get 285 seats, the reality could be something like 185-225 for BJP+."
BJP  for the nation will be the future growth of nation
This survey is irrelevant today ... coz much has changed since the survey.
Avoid 'Muslim Organisations- Congress Party' Alliance  !
How come even 1 percent of hindu vote for islamic party congress?
Andhra Pradesh its definitely wrong one mp already in same party and talks opposite to gov sitting in debates and there 5-6 guarenteed lose seats
"Even Opposition is Agreed on BJP building Roads, Railway, Airports and Infrastructure. That is the key and that only will help india growth."
Only BJP can save India
It's not times now it is times old 2019
The whole country knows that Modi will come up again
"Padmaja, i have been watching you .. of late say 6yrs not watching godi media. Rahulji Gandhi the greatest leader of all time in today's time, feku doesn't even come close to his shoes"
Bjp will win at least 35 out of 40 seats in Bihar..
Whatever finish by 2023 no election business 2024 on ward for dd means development domination n de dana dan globally no waste of time. As we hindus  let us have one name national party with 2teams as a and b as bjp to avoid political crime corruption n foreign interference. We need one caste one religion as hindu only with strong administration. Jai hind jai naya bharath.
As change is the order of nature let us vote for a change and see what the new elect pm can bring for the progressive growth and the economy of our nation
Why to dream today when it is happening tomorrow.
"Endia for congress, India for BJP Modi"
Modi will be back no doubt about it
People are tired of BJP govt looking for CHANGE now. Rahul Gandhi is a PEOPLE'S LEADER who can able to give a better govt than Modi.
"After seeing the ruling by Modi BJP, he had partially among the states and using the ED, CBI and courts on only opposition parties leaders and his own party had criminals and protecting the industrialist who are doing frauds and ego problem and financially he wouldn't like visionary leaders and jealous on them. Finally he feel he is the only cleaver on the earth. Destroyed AP and Amaravati and all are lies when you seen the AP. So badly need change."
What happened to WB?
Good approach
INDIA - 2 I = NDA.
Only Modi!!!
Tamilnadu bjp 00 Ç  tamilnadu bjp biggest apposite party NOTA

"1. If Hindu voters are 100 and if 2. HINDU Voters going to the voter counter is 70% to 75% BJP WILL GET 265 to 275 SEATS 3. If it is. 75% to 85% then 275 to 290 seats 4. If it is 85% to 90% then 290 to 300 seats 5. If it is 90% to 95% then 315 to 360 seats for BJP 6. CAN BJP BRING 90% OF HINDU VOTERS TO VOTING COUNTERS? 7. HINDUS ONLY EITHER MAKE OR BREAK A VOTE FOR BHARATHVARSH 8. OPPOSITION/UNITY ETC. ARE OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO BJP LOSS OR GAIN. SO, BHARATH MATHA SHALL PREVAIL"
There is going to be a huge Rahul wave in India which will sweep away Sangh parivar 
I am confident in TN..DMK won't get any seats..People are frustrated with family businesss... daily daily minting money.. who ever give freebies ..those parties will make Huge money for every nano second.
The opposition leaders will never come together so Modi will be back with more seats then 2019
Jai congress
Bjp ignored and has no will to win Bengal. They are visible only before election.
Is Ashutosh crying or laughing ?
Bjp has vision and mission. Rahul bhai cant even speak well about his motherland and insulting her. Who will vote for him. He has no ideas only revenging mentality like child in the nursery 
I guess it's just a confusing survey..
Vote for bjp..save the nation
Look at the TMC rep.they are talking about plan for 5 years??? Do they have any plan in WB?
"Apologies ,the count is wrong for AP btw ......"
"Vote share for congress is completely wrong definitely it will be less than 19 percentage because congress have good fight in Punjab, kerala and West Bengal because they have won last time with good vote but this time ruling state government will cut their votes so its wrong Statics"
Only Modiji!!!
Lets say BJP has 0 credibility...the others have negative credibility...so who wins is quite evident
"Times now have taken money from  Jagan Mohan Reddy to build his image by giving 24 to 25 seats in the survey. I bet Times now , ysrcp Jagan Mohan Reddy will not cross 2 seats in mp and will not cross 20 in assembly seats"
In this corrupt opposition families political parties who is PM candidate. He should be in top of corrupt list and doing against India and Hindus
Bjp will get more than 350 plus
Better Let it be Congress.
"Modiji.,the.most  efficient leader  for pm  2024"
Im from Karnataka  even though congress rulling KA but  Modi  is not an  option he is necessary
Ysrcp in ap clean sweep 
BJP zindabad. Namo will be the PM again in 2024. Jai Shree Ram
Tamilnadu congress 14 percentage vote share is a joke
Only BJP.
"Give vote only to the educated.
Voter Elegibility Test should be implemented."
Indian media is becoming nauseating day by day. In no other country the election talk would begin so early. Even  a leaf moving in the wind is politicized and all the channels are licking the govt's feet.
NDA will win 2024 election confirm point
"400++++++++++
SATHYAEMEVAJAYATHAE
FOR SINCERITY"
YES. THIS IS THE RIGHT SURVEY. BJP WOLL COME WITH MORE THAN 350 SEATS
"No bigger law was passed on political and government officials looters after modi 10 years rule,finding new party like Singapore action party in future"
khangress is dreaming.
Mr. Modi will be happy with your result..
More than 10 yrs to any political party is bad.
"Person love this country love modiji. Person hate modiji hate this country. Help him to help us.
(VOTE )"
"Only bjp
Only modi"
Overall it is wrong Survey
Congress will form the Govt in 2024 hands down.... Inflation is enough to throw away Modi and bring change.
Modiji will sit in opposition after elections cent per cent
In 2019 there was anti modi wave but now it is changed people are fed up of DMK and stalin Annamalai has taken the baton  and sailing smooth tamil people are hero worshippers amnnamali is emerging as hope
Mam.. I have a doubt.. In TN you showed 25% for others.. could please tell me.. who is this person going to get.. such a huge margin after DMK.. if you really be a neutral   unbiased TV..
As usual we know who ul show
"TODAY BJP 350 + , TOMORROW  BJP 375+ , DAY AFTER BJP 400+ ."
Now is the time of Congress 0:34
Bengal BJP 0 seat
BJP gets maximum190  seats in the next parlyment  election and definetely lost power .
2024will be a non modi or non BJP government
One and the  only Option is Modiji.
"Times Now poll survey of Karnataka 2023 poll showed 91 Congress / 89 BJP/40 JDU / Others 4 ,   that answers questions on Times Now's survey credibility. Times Now Karnataka 2023 exit poll showed Congress 113/ BJP 85/ JDS 23. this further exposed Times Now's lack of ground-level survey capability. 
An RSS internal survey conducted by a  psephologist of national repute in the past 30 days suggests BJP 199/ Congress 186 if General elections were conducted in the 2nd and 3rd weeks of  2023.  This made  RSS BJP top guns rush for a meeting in the absence of Modi during his US visit. A second survey is commissioned by RSS in the past few days to be headed by another psephologist of high repute and no bias.  in the event, Congress gets 199 seats or even 150-160 seats, and TMC, DMK,   NCP +SS,  AAP, JDU +RJD are expected to sweep their respective states along with   Yogi losing 40 seats in UP to SP and BSP, the post-election scenario would as tight as mouse's ass for Modi who is left with no credibility due to poor political mauves in the past 1 year.    If BJP doesn't show another face other than Modi for campaigning BJP's post-2024 general election status is a forgone conclusion. If BJP keeps  Modi as their face Congress and Rahul Gandhi must be very thankful to the BJP leadership"

"Narendra Modi after becoming the PM of India, transformed India in many ways, people might complain that he didn't do this and that, but its not easy to fulfill all promises yet he did fulfilled a lot, my village didn't had toilets, Modi made toilets almost everywhere under swachha bharat scheme, unlike puppet Manmohan Singh Modi is well respected in different countries, thanks to him our country has a name and as they say A nation with a strong leader is consider to be the strongest. If Rahul Gandhi or these loser coalition league gets into power they will destroy our nation. As a responsible citizen we should support BJP for the betterment of our country. We can't let these corrupted opposition party fools to take the responsiblity of our country only to destroy it."

Now for 34 election there may be an allianc e with BJP and kumsraswamy.  Iin that Senior the combined vote share will be more than 61 PV"
RAHUL GANDHI JI next pm of india in 2024
BJP will get MODI.3 100%& no doubt at all but don't be over confident because team I.N.D.I.A.will come out with all sorts of free bees to attract innocent voters which must be handled cautiously since  even in a Kerala called 100% literate society went after fee bees & now feeling the heat & pain.

"Congress will win with thumping majority, some agencies, channels taking money from ruling parties, like BJP, YSRCP in AP doing favoratism . In AP TDP alliance is going to get bumper majority and at central congress alliance is going to win"
Modi is the only choice for the country
Still congress gets over 100 .?? Congress deserves actually nothing for its antinational activities. When Raul and PC and Sonia talk on election propaganda then BJP tally will improve.
NDA -0 in TN
Jai modi
I'm from Karnataka pls dont ever vote to Congress pls to vote you local and bjp for a better ways

Bjp will reach 370 easily...at the time of election modi will reduce diesel petrol cost and other essential food grains so again modi will return thumping majority
Bjp will get 341 seats in2024.loksabha election.   Pm should impliment pension for  all  after 60 poor people .the sum should be 325o per month.only trains and roads not bring votes of poor

Aayega to MODI hi
"Unity in India doesn mean favoring muslims all the time. Congress ruled for decades after independence and instilled in our minds that muslims are superior. Name any Bollywood Muslim actor who is not married to a Hindu girl. There will be less than 1% of them. Agenda of congress has always been to be biased against Hindus and favour Muslims. On the other hand, BJP taught us to be proud of our roots. BJP taught us that we are no less than anyone else. BJP never said that Islam is bad but BJP did make us realise that Islam is evil to Hindus, which is a fact. BJP is not just about religion, but BJP is about growing ahead along with staying connected to your roots. How can you justify ignoring your roots in the sake of modernisation. Congress has always let Muslims do whatever fuck they wished for and has always been biased towards other religions specifically Hindu. It time to wake up!!!! God has himself taken birth as Modi ji to protect us all "
Godi media comedy

BJP WILL GET 25 SEATS  in WEST BENGAL CPIM PLUS CONG WILL RISE SOME

You started your work to make Modi as Next PM. Not going to succeed.
"Ms.Padmaja ,
You have been excellent in handling this diverse group of panelists...
Pl ask the likes of Ashutosh why BJP should be defeated ?
Is it because opposition is able to offer better Governance to the country ?
Is it because opposition is able to offer a better PM candidate...?
Ashutosh is considered as a very senior and enlightened political journalist.
It is amply demonstrated by his dumping the tiny CM of Delhi much before he showed his colours.
It is inexplicable that he is opposing BJP knowing fully well what the family parties have been  dishing out when they were in power.
And is batting for a khichdi sarkar instead of a nationalist party like BJP....
Congratulations Padmaja .
You have a very bright future..."

"Now that the election is close, Gandhian Modi is thinking of Hindus for the first time since he won the election in 2019.  He need Hindu votes even though he did nothing for Hindus.  So now he started a talk on UCC which will get him Hindu votes.  This is the man who did not have the guts to implement CAA yet.  The law is passed, but gandhian Muslim loving Modi has shelved.  He is not going to implement it because Muslims are against it.  If he passes UCC at all, you can bet on it that he will not implement it.  We need BJP, but we do not need a gandhian at the top."
only BJP
Totally disagree with Karnataka seats BJP will get atleast 22 seats i am from Hubli Karnataka also jdu bjp alliance this time
Only bjp
modi will loose..
I.N.D.I.A is making it easy for BJP by ensuring congress mukt bharat!
As a Maharashtrian I don't see any hope for any party other than BJP.
"ONE QUOTE WHICH ABSOLUTELY FITS FOR MODI IS:: ""HATED BY MANY DEFEATED BY NONE"""
Fact is bjp slogans are hindutva but you can't ignore they are doing much better than congress
"Love to see you frustration man
As a young Indian I want to see stable government rather so called opposition party Unity."
"Me:-can Modi win 2024 
Modi:-jarurüòÇ"
"I am not a bhakt but i do understand politics and economic policies made by bjp government. The leaders in opposition are not saints nor are the bjp ones but i know that in haryana discrimination in recruitment of public servants has dropped down drastically. And their economic policies are quite satisfactory than the earlier ones.

That's why i support MODI‚ù§"
"Every Political party in opposition aspires to become PM. Rahulji, Mamtaji, Nitishji, K C Raoji...to name few.
Whereas , BJP is crystal clear...Modiji will be their PM candidate."
BJP doesn't believe in good or bad. It believes in being powerful or powerless.
"The problem is not that bjp is too good, the problem is opposition is too bad or bunch of anti-nationals."
"Doesnt matter whether you hate or love Modi, you have to admit that he is a giant walking on the Indian soil like an elephant who can crush anybody who comes in his way. This man have not lost a single election since he started contesting them, 15 years undefeated as the cm of Gujarat and now 10 successful years as the pm, he has become a giant in this profession, you cannot defeat him you can just wait for the time when he resigns and Bjp people fight with each other for post until then aayega toh Modi hi"
"Well, 
Gone are the days when we had leaders like Vajpayee. We only have politicians now. 
And BJP under Modi is nothing but a election winning machine. 
You can hate their politics but cant deny the fact that they are by far the best government at the centre in the last few decades. 
Having a strong centre gives us stability and mind you, if the opposition under so many leaders with no vision for India manages to dethrone BJP, they would end up creating more harm than the good for their country. 
Gotta accept that they have no vision for this country except for defeating Modi. 
BJP on the other hand have a vision. Atleast when it comes to hard infrastructure which is enough to influence a positive change in the way the world perceives our country.

I just dont understand why you dont talk about the populist policies of the opposition parties. They are stooping so low to the point where they are even ready to bring back the old pension scheme just for the sake of few votes. That is how desperate they are. And mind you that's a really dangerous path to pursue. 
You may hate BJP but they are fiscally pragamtic and that is what we need. A stable and fiscally pragmatic govt with a strong will to build capital assets for the country. 
And that is why I vote for BJP. Not for its Hindutva politics but for it being my only hope for having a better infrastructure in this country."
"5 another reasons why BJP in 2024 is inevitable-
1- Welfare schemes have ground level presence
2- Infrastructural push is visible which attracts urban and liberal voters
3- Public wants majority government. we know how policy paralysis happened during coalition era.
4- Strong workforce of BJP
5- Biggest masterstroke still remains- Ram Mandir inaugration in Jan 2024."
"My vote goes to development. Hands down there's no comparison the development in railways be it railway expansion, modernization, improving connectivity that this government has achieved is incredible not to forget the road corridors for faster road connectivity. I mean opposition and the ruling party can fight on ideological lines but folks who are truly independent would most likely stick with BJP."
Weak opposition is the main reason that increases the chance of BJP winning 2024 elections...
Modi is hated by many but defeated by none
"No matter whoever, whatever people are fighting for but my vote will go for BJP. Look I m from Arunachal Pradesh, grew up in Congress era and now BJP. I have seen/seeing the differences between them when it comes to prioritizing NE for overall developments. Hands down! BJP has done it all. These all ideological/communal/religion battles that other parts of the country are pursuing doesn't work on us (NE). Priority and development is what all we wanted, now it's all being delivered. BJP Especially Modi again in 2024."
Any BJP fans in the house of this Deshbhakt? Shoutout For Modi-Shah!!! More Power to the BJP!
"Media to Modi Ji - Isbaar aap oppositions ko kaise harayenge ??
Modi Ji - Main kyu haraunga , iss kaam ke liye to wo log khud hi kaafi hai"
"The problem with NDA is that they had less than 50% votes in past and even this alliance in going to degrade the reputation of many parties and trust of voters but still it won't let BJP to cross margin of 50%. What I.N.D.I.A needs is, ""Strong PM Face"", ""Manifesto"", ""Social Media Propagandas"" and ""Appeal to people""."
That Smile of Bhakt Banarjee never gets old

"I prefer BJP but I loved this video. This really shows how dumb and egoistic the ""vs BJP"" parties are. They say BJP are misusing Hindutva and all so why don't they take the initiative of the growing Hindutva Ideology in their way? I don't see anything wrong with supporting Swadeshi Culture & revival of traditions."
"Love these detailed election videos!‚ù§
Want more!üòä"
"There is a reason why there is 'Opposition dis-unity'. All the opposition parties have different ideologies and agendas and some of them don't even have a growth mindset (look at Bihar and UP for example). Now, even if they come together, they are going to end up breaking up and the voters are going to feel cheated, for a simple reason i.e. different mindsets and ideologies and if all these parties come together to beat BJP, that itself should be 'Red Flag' for the voters! I believe that we need a strong opposition to challange BJP, which unfortunately we don't."
The biggest problem is a weak opposition. The parties who were clearly against in the past are now sticking together. That's a sign of weakness and people don't trust that.
"It's a walkover for BJP as there is no opposition. I had high hopes from AAP a few years back but the way they have handled Punjab in recent times has been a real disappointment. As long as Modi is alive and healthy, he will continue to remain the PM."
Vote For BJP 2024 Guys India Ko Fully  Developed krna hai 
Opposition has failed to create an anti BJP sentiments among the Indian masses. Till that happens BJP would triumph
"Keep making videos they are not just eye opener but also makes me think on what kind of drastic changes our country is facing... ""Change is important but only if it is for the betterment of the society...."""
The one thing Rahul Gandhi doesnt understand is that ‚Äúthe more you oppose your adversaries the more popular they become
opposition tried to paint hindutva as terrorism islam as secular only boosting hindutva
thats what type of content we want. really appreciate your work sir
Jai Shree Ram Ab ki baar Fir se Modi Sarkar Love from West Bengal
I would like to see a majority party.. instead of ...5-10 party coming together.. that will surely hinder India's economic development
"I have a question for everyone rooting for the comeback of opposition. How long do you think this so called ""maha gathbandan"" will last even if it comes to power?
I dont see either of the prominent leaders relinquishing their face as the leader of the opposition. I think that future would be a much more dire scenario."
Congrats on reaching 3M subscribers. Thank you for providing best infotainment content on YT 
Very good work bro
"I think you should have added a sixth point - Opposition parties themselves can't remain controversy-free. Case in point - Nitish Kumar who is jet-setting all over the country as the self-appointed unifier of the opposition, tweaked rules he himself had created to ensure a murder-convicted person got released from jail.
And everyone that met him - and hasn't protested that action - got tainted as implicitly supporting such acts."
"In our area, congress govt used to build asphalt roads which needed to be built every year because of rain damage. BJP came, built cemented roads and now they are in perfect condition for more than 5 years. Highway expansion, metro expansion, full 24 hr electricity availability, all govt services available digitally, UPI and many other good things."
There are more Prime Ministerial candidates in the opposition than number of opposition parties
Congratulations AB and Deshbhakt team on 3M. 
"MR AKASH, WE ALL ARE OF THE SAME OPINION. THE OPPORTUNITY IS STILL IN THE HANDS OF OPPOSITION PARTIES. COMMUNICATION IS THE KEY. VERY WELL DONE EPISODE. THIS EPISODE IS FOR ALL THE LEADERS OF OPPOSITION."
I think it will 320-350 seats for BJP but I will vote to BJP
Aana bhi chahiye modi ko hi. Hope in the coming yrs we get to see UCC and NJAC. No more nepotism in judiciary pls 
NDA Vote share was 45%. BJP alone had got 38%. Correct your facts.
I wish opposition  should see this  informative prediction video to understand and plan accordingly
"7:38 +1 to that point. Even in Telangana, BJP was cleverly attempting to shift the lesser resolute MLAs out of TRS by means of bullying or incentives. The reason why TRS didnt collapse yet is because the party leadership has seen DECADES of the game of political trading, and have a shrewd idea how to stay afloat. The challenge will be tough for BJP in Telangana though, as far as I can see."
I know all government seek power and self benefit... But as a Hindu and ofcourse as a bharatiya I support BJP's hindutva driven moment because it did encouraged nationality rastrabhakti in people like me who was zero interested in politics and country related affairs but now I feel more connected to Bharat and I feel motivation to do something for my country üòä‚úåÔ∏è opposition me unity ho ya na ho bjp ne janta ke bich unity jarur la Diya hai ü§£ü§£
This episode is a prelude to the opposition parties to come together and form a Gathbandhan 
Bro analysis should be put forward as to how many seats combined to gives an edge for opposition and which of these states combine together will out beat .. thas important .
I want Deshbhakt to make a video on this recent Arvind Kejriwal controversy over 45 crore house.
Akash this is a superb episode. You are on target. If opposition does not open their eyes and ears they will be dumped in 2024.
Frustration on Akash's face lo
Akash banerjee and dhruv rathee dil se- he bhagavan ye dukh kahe khatam nhi hota 
"As a normal citizen, I will  definitely vote for BJP , BJP is best for centre , we couldnt elect Vajpayee ji for second time , but now as a voter we dont want to miss Modi ji , we want to see him again as a PM , right now in opposition we dont have any candidate who can be consider better than Modi ji as of now‚Ä¶ one thing I noticed no scams in BJP compared to UPA , I m not blaming UPA but now only for Modiji"
The best line was when he said (2ab) I like your videos but m pro BJP because I want the opposition to be strong enough as BJP so that there is a balance 
"One more thing about Modi is his foreign policy.....unless a strong foreign policy is built, export import will not develop, ITs will not advance and mncs will not appear,which ,in every aspect is needed for our country's employment factor...till now Modi has tried hus best to strengthen the same....so vote for Modi..2024‚ù§üéâüéâüòä‚ù§ missing in all the comm"
"The major problem of the opposition is they are still trying to defeat BJP by saying they are not doing right things. But nowhere  any party is talking about what are the right things and what are their plan of actions to implement those. And a united opposition is always going to be a disaster, much worse than BJP itself where either many want to be PM aspirant or HM.

Till they really project who is going to be standing against Modi and bring a PM candidate face, things will not be changed. Gone are those days where elections were fought bottoms up, choosing MLA/MP and the intern selecting PM. People don't even trust the people they vote for."
This is the perfect videos which explains the major problems of why modi again and again 
Sarcasm mixed with strong arguments....At Best again! Hats off sir!
from karnataka voted Congress in assembly election. But vote for Modi in 2024
I am not a hardcore modi but i dont think we currently  want any unstable government with all the opposition parties as i very well know after 2024 they all are again to fight among each other . So till 2029 BJP is unstoppable. Hope so AAP gains more popularity and support by then
Being Gujarati i very happy to see this
Sometimes Bhakt Banerjee predicts earlier than The Deshbhakt Banerjee.
"Solid five points, Aakash and team, for why BJP may win 2024. Now please come up with five points going in favour of the opposition parties. Something like these: two-term incumbency at Centre; staleness of BJP‚Äôs messaging; lack of credibility of BJP as alliance partner; slack in resources inflows as Adani is in trouble; and peaking of Modi branding and recent dents in reputation and popularity. Let‚Äôs see what comes outü§ûüèº"
"Please do an episode on Mamta Di and how successfully she has managed West Bengal. And how under her visionary leadership West Bengal has turned out to be the best performer in every economic and social aspect with highest employment, best health and education infrastructure, social harmony etc etc. I'm sure there is a lot to cover. Eagerly waiting. Big Fan. More power to you üëçüëç"

"Maturity is when you realised that 
Something is better than nothing
BJP = something
Opposition = nothing"
"MODI is doing great job !! 
We Indians living in US,UK, UAE etc feel proud that we are Indians !!

India has got world respect after Modiji came to power ‚ù§"
Didn't see Bhakt Banerjee for so many days! Bring him back!!
Excellent analysis as always. Someone forward this to opposition parties. They won't listen or understand anyways. Anpad will return and the loot will continue.
I have spent my life time in assam under congress rule and can say one thing that it was pathetic specially if you live away from capital as even the big towns other than capital were lacking in basic infrastructure be it like electricity or health or roads but after the BJP came to power even the most ardent supporter of congress now admits that things have really improved a lot. Now so many jobs got created in govt sector only although temporary but people are saying that why congress could not bring this development even when they were in power in state and centre simultaneously and how come BJP is doing all this in such a fast way thats why i support MODI for bringing development in a much more faster way
In 2018 assembly elections in madhya pradesh mayawati's bsp refused pre-poll alliance with Congress inspite best effort of congress. But bsp supported congress govt unconditionally post poll . Same happened in Rajasthan. In 2024 if congress reaches atleast 120 seats of out of 543 I think entire opposition will support it post poll.
Look at frustration at his face 
BJP
"I am not an Andhbhakt and am well aware of BJP's politics, but opposition aren't any saints either. From what I could gather, you're just desperate to throw BJP out and not caring about who are we going to bring in. Maybe one single majority party isn't a good idea, but how is getting 10 different parties with different agendas and different regional strongholds a better idea? Here we are talking about one single party doing nasty stuff for their political ambitions, what about when all regionally strong parties in power play tactics to meet their political ambitions? We seem to forget that EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM is a politician."
"BJP would win 200-250 seats if the opposition unites , 300+ if things remain the same ... 350+ seems too far fetched even in current scenario since BJP has already maxed out in key states and even retaining those numbers would be a big achievement for BJP"
"myself not being either rightist or leftist, but its true that, theres no substitute of bjp now üòÇ, the best part of bjp at centre is the way they r putting best minds on the top lyk, nitin gadkari for infrastructure, jaishankar for mantaining foreign affairs, sudhanshu trivedi as influencer, himanta and manymore as different choices to become cm and pm, 
the only way to win for opposition is to show some real leaders who can govern this country better than them, and, according to me, its impossible for opposition to do üòÇ"
So true and insightful analysis. People have brought BJP in power again and again not because they all are modi fans but because there is no strong alternative. It is not strength of modi which leads to victory but a weak oppsition.
"If not BJP then who , whom should the young generation trust atm ?"
"Even if india had a strong opposition, BJP would still have managed to win the elections single handedly but yea they would not be able to achieve the 350 mark.üòÖ"
"What a nice Analysis bro... Really you need to listen by opposition parties, so that they can learn something..."

"Dear akash i badly miss your rondlu reaction after 2019 result. We all India's proudly 38% Indian Rising Voters are waiting your same Rondlu reaction after 2024 and 2029 results. 

Dear akash You are Just awesome in field of hyprocracy."
"You know why i love bjp and banerjee frustration 

Bjp knows what is its core value which means they want to promote hinduism and spreading india's great achivements to all over the world 

Where Rahul and kejriwal are selfish they always promote ""prabhu Ram"" when election will come  

So i have many things to show you but these two points are also enough why other parties will loose from modiji and people are reliasing that who is great for him and its simple its modiji

Jai shree Ram üß°"
I am speaking from Odisha.  I agree with what you said.  But in the ground reality there are people of BJD here.Don't do everything for everyone.Practically and work for uneducated and easy manipulative people.But the leaders of BJP work for everyone.People who need them. Anytime I look around you see people go all out.  No one comes to work in Odisha to work. and that's the reality of bjd gov!!
"Amazing, you are really doing  great for us to get actual what's happening in our country politics n media"
"What an explanation given by you ...  Watching your video for very first time .. till now I'm thinking that no one can beat BJP ... You man... Just open my eyes, even I don't like BJP ...
Now I believe that i will be possible if opposition take control "

Well Explained Desh Bhakt bro really to the point and each n every sentence well researched
"As being real Deshbhakt, not so called ! I would like to see BJP again"
"I am a BJP supporter, but hats off to you bro.. No one in this country can match your level of sarcasm. Best wishes "
100% agree with you Akash ji. Your analysis is spot on
"Opposition too have their media house like print , the wire, bcc. I can't understand why people think that bjp is winning only because of media and not because of development too "
AB was almost crying throughout the video. Poor guy.
"I don't think this kind of opposition shall come into central power because even if BJP has its own flaws but it won't easily fall off from its place just because of internal conflicts. But when it comes to the present opposition parties they are not capable of cooperating with each other. Moreover if all these parties gets combined definitely their divided strength will come together and become a much greater strength along with which their flaws will also get combined and it will be disastrous for the entire nation. BJP with its own flaws and on the other hand opposition with its combined flaw, which is more harmful? The question of progress does not bear much relevance today in Indian politics rather the question of who is less harmful is relevant. Even if its an unfortunate fate that we all citizens are sharing, we must accept that this kind of good for nothing opposition must not hold central power in the name of democracy only."
6:42 NDA had a vote share of 45% in 2019. It's a factual inaccuracy.
"We want a bb episode with any celeb mantri sir,perfect analysis sirüíØ‚ù§"
"Another question is that even if opposition unites and wins the election, will they be able to run an efficient government? There would be too much conflict? I'm not a supporter of BJP but one thing about them is that compared to past governments they have made progress and they don't have much internal conflict that would hinder the working of the party."
"Vote for Nitin Gadkari, our visionary infra man ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I think AAP did manage to work on there there communication. Only disadvantage is that people these days at large are motivated by religion and that is all needed to drive them. Also, I am impressed with Rahul how is coming and trying to capture the vote bank that was almost lost. Yes, Congress could have done much more than what they did (which is actually nothing)."
Unfortunately we don‚Äôt have another option so congratulations Modi sir in advance for 2024 election

"Question of the decade  : if modi media is there , why can't  opposition makes  virodhi  media??

"So it must be like a reversal of time, just as in pre independence assembly when opposing ideologies like LEAGUE and MAHASABHA came together to meet their political aspirations!"
Brilliant Presentation
Loved your analysis sir 
INDIA alliance zindabaad
Every opposition parties must watch this episode of Bhakta Banerjee once.
"In my opinion,
This 2024 Elections will be BJP'S victory but at the same time may be the last one. 
Coz Rahul Gandhi and his Party are now maturing in poltics nowadays (if he have shown same Maturity in 2018-19, results would be different at present)."
BJP vs Congress is outdated now...modi vs deshbhakt should be on trend...but hat's off to u sir..I'm UPSC aspirants and master student too but still i always watch you ep. in first

Master stock MODI -January 2024 RAM MANDIR.. isliye aayega to MODI ...JAi shree RAM
Modi can go to any extent & I mean any extent to win the elections. So it is the responsibility of the opposition as well as the citizens to vote wisely.
Individuals who are expressing negative opinions about Modi in this forum are likely to vote for him regardless due to the absence of viable alternatives. The lack of a significant opposition at present means that there is no one who can effectively challenge Modi's leadership.
The problem with Indian politics is not about unity but polarization. They need to start changing the narratives and start to attack every issue. Start to support anything and everything against the govt
As per this logic of BJP 38% and non BJP 62% then ..congress should have never made in India as it hardly got votes above 50%. In 2004 & 2009 elections UPA got 25% and 28% votes so 75% and 72% didn't wanted UPA rule but still they formed Govt.
It's in the hands of people if they are educated and thinking for their future they will have to choose wisely
" This got me dying lmao. Aakash Bhai you should start Comedy Nights with Akash soon.

 AB isn't against Modi, but it doesn't make sense to question a party which has only 2-3 states ruling and elsewhere reduced to zero.
Since Congress was bad, it was kicked out from power by people of India.


Questioning genuine things isn't treason."
"Not because of opposition, because of modi‚ù§"
"It's not just one political party, the voters' motivated intention & preference matters."
"This analysis is on point. until now, the opposition has no alternative to the godi media."

"Very true analysis. Everything is already operating against the oppostion and by their own ego and internal differences, they are making it even worse for themselves."
AKKI BAR 
"After watching the video , i would like to say only one thing - AYEGA TO MODI HI"
"The country genuinely needs well educated politicians but most importantly a well educated rational population aka masses is the need of the hour. I hope a day comes when amendment of sections and clauses of different bills, creations of new bills and annual expenditures of the nation will take centerstage of elections. To do that people must be educated."
Loved this meltdown video 
"Thing is I want a stable government, even if it doesn't do things properly there will be peace in country compared to this opposition coalition which cannot decide it's pm candidate and each month someone new might be the prime minister"
Masterpiece. What an analysis. Mind-blowingly accurate.
"Bro i am a bjo supporter but i got to know from South Indian states that they don't hate modi, they hate bjo as Congress was more appropriate to them than bjp. So it fails in south. There was no credit to Rahul Gandhi for that. It was state government power. Even for central government, people from South will vote bit its lesser than that of north."
Congress sabhi ko B team ka leader batati  dead

"Congress has been in power for a long time in India, nothing better can be expected from Congress, if Congress comes to power in 2024, then their real game will be seen, not only for the people but for their own development and the development of their own party."

"You rightly said, opposition is almost nonexistent!! God save our nation!!"

"May be you have an ideological difference with our PM Modi but you have to agree that his cabinet ministers are by far the best cabinet ministers of all time.

3) Dr. S. Jayshankar----former IFS and many more....."
"Finally ""Deshbhakt"" realizing the facts "
"One statistical coincidence for thought: when Indian stock markets are showing green, digital media says Ayega toh Modi; when Indian stock markets are deep red, digital media knows only criticism of Modi.

Now things are easier for BJP with poor economic condition of Pakistan; this time 3 more Pulwama like incidents can be engineered prior to May 2024. And mark my words that there is a 99.99% probability that there will be multiple Pulwama type incidents and Satyapal Mallik will be proven beyond doubt as a liar."
Division of Andhra Pradesh also played a crucial role in decline of congress
Funny how the reporter who Rahul called BJP supporter was actually a Congress supported xD
Very apt analysis by aakash. Oppositions internal fighting and lack effective public relations machinery is going to cost them another election.
Thankyou for your 'neutral' content.
Petition for deshbhakt to do an interview with bhakt Banerjee like he did with dhruv rathee

"We can't really control what opposition parties do. I wish we could, but unfortunately it's something they will have to figure out themselves.
I will certainly do my bit. As soon as the voting date is announced for my constituency, I will apply for leave and travel to cast my vote. It's my duty to help my country and to do my bit in keeping the democracy alive."
Modi 
Atlast spoke something on the cowardice of the opposition parties ! ‚ù§
"A very astute explaination. This is best time opposition to take stand. No no not against Modi. But in favour many national issues. (Not again not by saying million time adani.....adani.....adani). There are thousands of problems. 
There is one simple solution for opposition (congress) to rise back ""keep one family outside"".

Cabinet ministers of NDA are more famous then these opposition politicians. Ofcourse they will win.
"Being as a common citizen, what can we do for the sake of saving this nation from any more irreparable damages ?

Kindly make an episode on this, help us in finding the right perspective. And help us in finding what we as a common voting citizen can do, in order to change the most probable results of 2024 ( as per current scenario).

Please, we still have a year. Should do whatever we can, and also at times whatever is actually needed (no matter if we can or not, but we need to so we have to).

I want to hope for good. I want to do what's actually needed. No matter how hard time is left now.

Hope I'm clear what I wanted to say.
Being a random citizen, I'm really not having much insight about it. So asking for right guidance regarding it.

Thankyou."

Donot weep. You cannot defeat BJP.
"Based on current opposition situation, BJP will get 350+.. Congress needs to shed the GANDHI TAG Dependency and take  back seat and stop its dream that it is the only party which can fight against BJP. Also Rahul Gandhi is still a novice w.r.t politics and if Congress wants to project him as the PM face then donot be surprised, if BJP gets 400 and above seats"
The Opposition is becoming strong day by day. and they will continue to do so in the coming days. Aakash by making this episode doesn't change anything. You made this episode too early to predict 2024

"Bjp has power,money,resources and a very strong narrative building team...i guess this united opposition theme might work if they fight state elections and others first...like they should start fighting election unitedly just after the 2024 election....because to beat bjp it can't be done in less than 365 days.

But really it's just shocking how the RSs Modi-shah had changed the indian politics...Important issues are of not much importance now in election"
"Hahahaa very very true!!! Loved this video. 

2:31  is the main factor üòÖüòÖ"
Lets the final battle begin in 2024 elections. Its Modi vs all. Its a battle of credibility. Its a battle against popularity of modi. And I am 100% sure Bjp will win singlehandedly and will perform better than 2019. Opposition will not find place to hide their faces

"The world is changing. If you look not only at the election point of view, India is now recognized as an emerging nation and finally the Indian currency is showing its true power. Despite all the cons of BJP, I guess it has more power and advantages and I dont think any other leaders are capable of making such big decisions. Even if BJP wins it again, I wont be disappointed as it deserved it.
Also we need strong opposition party and leaders, not clowns and pappus :) The sooner we realize this the better."
I love kajriwal sir

The commendable part of BJP isnots wonderful communication. It's unmatched by the Opposition and they are ahead of the Opposition by eons.

Till the time Modi is actively involved in politics; it is going to be extremely tough for the opposition to defeat the BJP... He perfectly knows how to tackle public sentiments...
My vote is always for BJP.. we need educated candidates more like mr jay shanker sir.. may bjp have lost election in Karnataka but i believe this just a beginning
"I believe since 2014 BJP is winning because of just one man, the Star Pracharak of BJP, Mr.Rahul Gandhi"

"Ayegi to BJP.There is no opposition.I am not a BJP bhakt but I am from Assam and I can see the progress,the development of roads and infrastructure in Assam under BJP rule .The development of health care under Himanta Vishwa sharma and how covid wave was tackled by him . That was commendable..Congress ruled Assam for 15 years and in those 15 years they never focussed on roads,infrastructure and only focussed on bringing illegal immigrants from the neighboring country and giving them voter card.

"I will turn 18 this December and next year i will definitely cast my vote for BJP in loksabha election.

After realising that bjp has just espoused a veneer demeanour of hindutva to fool tranced & ingenuous Hindus for its political frolic & how much pusillanimous & dotish this party is(especially after the whole Manipur drama & their apathy towards meitie hindus) I've changed my mind, I've realised that bjp is just an official  surrogate of Congress posing as messiah of Hindus with a seductive/spurious poise, it's a party of Renegades who've successfully bamboozled Hindus for their political pre-eminence.
Any Hindus who is perspicacious regarding contemporary political scenarios will not fall prey to this faux hindutva party."
Aayga to modi hi 
Major factor is kattar Hinduism of bjp.majority in Indians are Hindus and now most of them are now towards bjp side due to Hinduism factor.which is not countered by opposition.until this factor is not focused opposition is not going to win even 2024
"Good analysis, Akash."
Sir I don't know abt anyone but we JAMMU peoples completely support modi...for us he is like god

"One thing we must praise about BJP is that BJP is very Hardworking , persistence party.
And Future belongs to those who work hard."
"BJP, NDA and modi has the corporate support and so their failures will never be questioned and instead it will be whitewashed by the media, whereas they will praise and credit the central govt and Modi as much as possible. And the media always blames the opposition for any problems and crisis in the country whereas in every country the media questions the ruling government and supports the opposition. As long as media continues to support the central govt, hides/distracts the public from the critical issues facing the country, they will continue to be in power. Hope everyone realises this."
BJP ne agar is baar kaam nhi kiya to desh ki band baj jayegi. Hume kisi bhi haalat me 8% ke upar ki gdp growth chahiye. 2011-2021 ka pura decade bas 5.6% growth hua hai which was too low.

Each Opposition should declare their PM candidate so that people will know to whom they are voting for. But opposition don't have single leader who can stand against Modi ji. It shows in  30+ years political career all leaders done nothing to the country.
Aapki baar 350 ke sath.... Firse Modi Sarkar 
"Chalo Maan liya ki opposition milkar government bna lete hai

What is more surprising is people don't outrage over things which would have led to fall of government in other countries.
"First time i have seen too neutral analysis by you (though I can't claim that i have seen all of the episodes). But there are few sane voices remaining who are 'neutral' per se. People like me are irritated by so called Godi media (including Godi social media) , but we are equally bored by futile and pity attempts of anti-BJP channels. In this era , such analysis feels like cool breeze.

Opposition is living in hope without any execution. This point is right more than everything.
The sadness in his voice 
Voter's unity is very much needed to save our motherland.
ONLY MODI 
The Deshbhakt congratulationâfor you 3M family.
The President of INC has expressed the possible flexibility on his part. It means he is not insisting on the leadership of the opposition.
The point is Modiji has done a phenomenal job and right now no one can replace him. Opposition ke paas na agenda hai na vision hai na unity hai na hi koi accha leader hai aur na hi desh ke liye kaam karne ka motive hai
 Very true.
"BJP has epically conveyed its messages to the masses. This is where the opposition lack. Just look at how RaGa has gone silent recently after the disqualification.

"BJP will never lose 
Biggest reason is it's a religion based party,
Religion is a weak sentiment of every person, and BJP is intelligent enough to attack that sentiment, so it gets a huge support in India
BJP has taken India into a great international level, which Congress was never able to do,
But BJP caused a lot of communal hatred inside India and very less domestic development inside the country."
"AK says,"" I am the only educated person in the world, so give me vote instead of BJP 
RaGa says, "" Modi has sold the country, sold the people of the country, so give me vote instead of BJP 
Actually there is no such big issues in Opposition to fight against BJP"

Your editor deserves 15lakh for 
"I really appreciate your content and voracity. 
This time however, I disagree with you. Not with your prediction of modi winning, per se, but you giving voice to this horrendous possibility. 

There's a belief among voters not wanting their votes to ""go to waste"" should they vote for someone who ends up loosing. Yes it sounds like a self-contradictory argument of sorts. It is. But, it's true. Common folks think that its useless to vote for a party that is going to loose anyway. Their vote would get wasted. So they vote for someone they assume is going to win and that way their vote will ""matter"". 
I am not making this up. I have lived amidst simple, poor, uneducated folks, the one's who attend these politician's rallies for ‚Çπ100/ day and a real juice box, my whole life. They all seem to think along those lines (ofcourse, there's many a educated, affluent, etc. people that think along these lines too).
When influential people start making such fatalistic predictions, a perception starts to form and seeps to the very bottom. And these lower income, uneducated/low-educated folks are the ones that make up the lion's share of voters. So, such predictions, become self-fulfilling prophecies. 

I hope you're vary of this reality."

"Bro a strong party have to rule India for coming year as this decade is very important for the growth of the country and some bold step should be taken as every other country has their eyes on India today,and if a ruler party is made of the  different party merger with different mindset for each party ,then I think it is definitely not a good choice  against a stong party with a stong leader so definitely betting on BJP is better option then any other party ."

Jali na teri bhi jali na.. Ayega toh Modi hi..
You desperation to remove bjp government inspite their commendable development work and foreign policies is quite visible..but believe me aakash it's not goona happen anyhow whether opposition unites or divide..People are smart enough to decide whom they want to lead the country..

"Almost every opposition leader is defamed but not Modi.

"Looking at the current situation and knowing the extent of levels BJP is capable of getting to, be really surprised if Modi Ji doesnt come back in 2024. That said, should Modi Ji come back in 2024 my real concern is 2029!! There wouldnt be any elections by then. People will be conditioned to an unquestioning obedience. Digital Media will be silenced. Opposition will be crushed. Results of 2024 elections will be a deciding juncture of Indias future which unfortunately isnt looking too bright right now."
Even as someone who is not a BJP fan I think in lok sabha everyone needs to vote for BJP because we need a full majority government to take strong decisions for the country to progress
I request to make a video for the kerala story ..

"10 major achievement of BJP government 
1. They directly transfer all agriculture fund in bank account hence support farmer

20 . Better and resolved tax system 
After all to run country like India we need a strong government and we got that in Bjp , I won't say there is no corruption in bjp but 1000 times less compared to other lootera ... If not modi who ? Rahul Gandhi ? Tejaswi yadav? Or MAmta banarjee ? And you should be ashamed of yourself Akash you defame the majority voters even though you got no right to do so ... I will always vote for bjp until I don't get a better candidate"
"BJP will win elections for 5 reasons

Congratulations on 3Million  Aakash Sir .
Modi hi ayega.. student power dikhne ka tym agya ajyo student dikhyo power 
Major reason- Bjp is professional in playing with religious sentiments.
Love to see your frustrations.Bjp ne congress se better hi Kiya. Even shivsena is not hope now. As a Indian citizen I don't see any other hope than bjp
7:25 this means you want to say that opposition parties should forgive each other mistakes corruption etc just for the sake of unity....thats also one of the reason people dont want opposition parties to be in power ..hopefully you got my point..jai hind
A no fly notice on tadipar and 56 inch should be activated on all airports before 2024 results. There are high chances they might escape the country
Best explanation
"Despite of BJP's politics, atleast our nation is achieving some milestones like the roadconstruction speed, Railway infrastructure, Global ranking. Also,worldwide, India is getting a lot of attention nowadays and our Tradition is flourishing again. I think we are okay with this government instead of having a party who didn't do any huge work for India. Literally, for a Populated country like India, the development done in the 60 years was nothing.
Obiviosly they built the roads.But for a huge population, those roads are too small
Obiviosly they built the airports, railway stations. But again the population factor comes
India always needed to construct the things that should be the largest in the world.
But, they didn't built an infrastructure that is worthy of handling billions of people
India is correcting those mistakes now."
Kcr from south had a sharp tongue and great rhetoric power this time most fortunately can play good game

"If Rahul is pm opposite of modi,then 101% modi win 101% n 2024.very cleverly hindu leadership gave lots of seats n Bihar and UP"
"The difference between bhakt Banerjee and Modi bhakt is the difference between a aware person, a questioning individual and that of a person who is closed to reasoning and understanding. As many reasoning individuals world suggest,
a mind that reflects on the various angles and possibilities often fears of the outcomes, which is not the case with andh bhagtas or commonly known as Modi Bhagtas.
One support for the flickering mind that recognises CHAOS as the problem is the philosophical suggestion of order in chaos. 
Personally I don't see Modi or even BJP coming back to form any kind of government and also see the possibility of the party called BJP completely going out of existence.
AAP as suggested will not be in a position to play a role in forming the government and neither will the Congress party."
"The non-congress opposition parties fear the revival of Congress as much as they fear the dominance of BJP. This is why parties like TMC, BRS, RJD and others do not want to unite with Congress and cede space to congress in their respective states. They dislike Congress as much as they dislike BJP because till 2014, Congress was in the same position as BJP is today. 

The opposition is caught in a tangle.

Regional parties cannot unite with a national party at national level.

But a third font of regional parties without Congress is definitely possible. This third font will surely bag more seats than Congress if elections were to be held today."
Nailed it
"There is no credible opposition as they have completely reduced to a laughing stock by systemic direction by bjp. The rest of the opposition doesn't want congress esp rahul to an ally
Bjp has not warmed themselves to the voters but their strategy was to destroy the congress. They initially mocked Nehru, rahul ,indira.. now they don't even bother to do that as no one is bothered about congress. Rahul is a good person by heart,  which means he is not a good pm material. Remember his action of tearing up disqualification  document."
We just want stable government rather than 26 Opposition Bhediya
Abki baar 400 paar!!!

"Haan mai hun andhbhakt jisko Jo bolna hai bolo i love modi,yogi only bjp."
AAP is slowly becoming a national party. Everyone is underestimating Arvind Kejriwal.
365 seat for bjp. Jai modi ji. Congress mukt bharat
A loss to the bjp currently is a loss to the country and its democracy reason... A hung assembly will lead to a weak government because bringing so many state leaders to lead against Modi is not possible modi is not a state leader he is the biggest international leader.. you can't get a government by bringing 10-12 state governments.. bjp should atleast win the needed seats to lead the government.
Congress shouldnt compromise with any opposition parties. BJP must be allowed for two more terms so  at least three generations of Indians are ruined.
the main reason why bgp is winning is because leader of opposition party is not up to the match for modi and they are not gaining people support because they are not exactly connecting with the same level as modi and foreign power and vocals of modi is still very strong
Boycott bjp
"I think the idea of opposition unity is flawed, reason for it would the very idea on which it rests: 62% of votes are anti-BJP. Ask a YSRCP Supporter or TDP supporter if they are anti BJP or anti Congress. It can be extended to many parties across India."
Please do an episode on why these political parties are not prioritising climate change and water crisis which will kill India
I have seen 70 yrs policy of congress and 8 yrs bjp and i am impressed by bjp so say what ever you want i will vote for bjp instead any gandhi dynasty 
"One point I dont agree with  ""AAP dont have plans for expansion"". AAP is well planned and working very systematically for further growth!"
Points you mentioned...are all extremely very valid...
"Well if INDIA manifesto will be promising 200 unit of electricity free for all indian, free Bus travel and such thing then i know who to vote for"
I dont think BJP will win by big margin. Bharat jodo yatra led by Rahul Gandhi has been a big influence in some states. Congress will surely try to replicate what they did in Karnataka. As a voter we just hope may the best man be elected as the PM of India.
"Pehli baar sahi baat kiye hain..

"The thing is that congress will never join rest of the oppositions so there are mainly three party going to fight in lok sabha 2024 congress, bjp and all opposition. muslims will never vote bjp but this muslim vote can be divided between all opposition and congress . More than 70 percent Hindu is going to bjp which leads to huge victory for bjp"
"The biggest problem with liberals is that they dont understand Modi keeps winning because of its focus on infrastructure and not religious reasons.
All the opposition leaders who have focused on development they have won many elections since 2014.
If you keep on talking about arithmetic , sear sharing etc that doesnt work or help in doing development"
"I  dont have hope when modi come to power2014 , now they bring to 2022 almost 9 years totally , they changed india. Every people  can see the change. Constitution  is not changed. They rule as keeping everyone together. One india onenation. Systematic, good organization,  compare with Congress  era of 2004 t0 2014, its far better , now im thinking what congress done to india. Really nothing Really nothing."

Agar man lo yeh gandhi, kejariwal, mamta, yadav ek sath aa bhi gaye toh bhi inme se koi ek hi PM ke umeed var khada hoga or yeh kon hoga isme bhi woh ladte rahenge"
"If anyhow bjp loses 2024's election then it will be on bases of calculation of lok sabha seats only.
Mark my words.
Bjp can not get 300+ seats this time.
As there is no strong opposition face to defeat modi at large. If opposition wins then there will be a collegium government. UP, gujrat and north-indian states again will be good performer in terms of LS seats won by NDA. 
So opposition should be good at calculation of seats as well as have faith in each other to remain united and strong."

"You didn't mentioned the most important factor that contributes to BJP's success the most, that is The RSS which has now gained much more influence during these 9 years. BJP just implement the things that RSS has created support for, at grassroot level. For eg Love Jihad is something new for current politics, but it has always been a part of agenda in RSS list.
Our current history which is believed to be written by leftists in India, you think BJP is changing it on its own ? 
No ! This thing was realized by RSS decades ago, they have arguments like why Mughal history covers 10 pages and Shivaji Maharaj is contained in half a page. Well I also agree that Medieval history is mostly dominated by Mughal, although there were other kingdoms also like Vijaynagar.
RSS sets the narratives and gather public support.
I also want to add on that this anti-hindu bollywood had always been in the hitlist of RSS and during the rule of BJP, anti-hindu ideology of bollywood has came to it's decline, because it's the RSS that works behind the curtains.
Even Narendra Modi can't go against the RSS, and don't think that RSS is just the org, RSS is everything Hindutva in India from publications to abvp, from BJP to Bajrang Dal, there's no field where RSS is not active."

"I do not know about other state, but ed, cbi doing great in west bengal....tmc party is corrupt"
Man there is no good party. Even bjp is also not so excellent in their work but i want to say one thing. Personally i don't see any good leader who can control both geopolitics as well as controlling the nation. Bjp is good in geopolitics but they are not doing extraordinary work for genrating employment but i have felt that the growth is slow but continuous. I don't see variety in politics every body is just same. Some just say bjp gives more advantage to hindu but i have seen many Muslim people getting benefits from the scheme organised by bjp. Personally i dont want to see politics in a narrow way. But i am confused as well.. I feel there is no poltician in our country who can do good in both geopolitics as well as inside the nation

"Lol, the non BJP states you mentioned, the opposition isn't united. Rather, they are the only party that exist in the state. Btw, one point that you mentioned, Hindutva and Nationalism are great tools for attraction, which unfortunately other parties fail to realize. If you want to defeat BJP, bring an alternative party that runs on the above two similar narratives. Left and liberals are getting exposed too badly, not to mention secularism concepts aren't helping either. And btw, BJP hasn't brought any govt policy that is anti muslim or deprives them of any kind of opportunity/resources. All the welfare schemes have large inclusions of minorities and even their rights (triple talak verdict is historical)."

"I do not understand, what do you want from voters, there is no party powerful enough to compete against BJP but even if they somehow make coalition, they are not competent enough to represent India, they will eventually fall out, so my question is what should a voter should do. I realise, sorry we realise that election are being won by religious propagandas and patriotic beliefs without any actual major development but I don't think we have an option. I hope BJP one day do not feel the need to use religious propagandas to win elections, so that there will be less of Hindu vs Muslim and India vs Pakistan. If you people are so addicted to fight somebody then look to your left, there is a more than worthy opponent, already playing with you."

"No PM face in opposition. You just can say that it will be people's choice. Total bullshit. Do you really feel that opposition will accept RG as PM? Even if I accept they will, crack will appear within those parties after 6-7 months of ruling, in case the opposition wins 2024. Biggest problem is Congress cannot fight election alone, they need support & in all states, the parties which are part of opposition unity are fighting amongst themselves. First time I can see that so many emergence of youtubers who are trying their level best to make people understand that BJP is bad & Congress is good & here lies the big problem. Not giving importance to other parties & for these you tubers, opposition only means Congress, precisely  Rahul Gandhi."

Why dont you talk about opposition rahul ghandhi going to usa? Why dont you talk about a fallacy being created that minorities are in danger by world media? Why dont you talk about khalistani and isi militants being killed in operations? Everyone has their own narrative and leaning and yours is completely visible. This govt has done ground level work like implementation of the schemes which no one can deny and yes they have stopped appeasing to the minorities especially of one particular group and yet that group is getting all the benefits but not appeasement. That the whole problem.

Only Modi ji and Yogi
you call yourself a Deshbhakt. But its clear u r biased! U should be neutral in ur content.
"deshbhakt Congress and AAP is fully clean
no issues they have
or your are just anti BJP?"
FENKU EXPRESS AND HIS FENKU GODI CHANNEL
Bhai tu apne channel ka naam  deshbhakt ke jagah modibhakt rakh le
Opposition kaha se kuch bolege bjp kuch utpatang kare to sahi sab bekar log opposition me he bhare pade hai
Your double standard
"Me and my friends were initially in support of this government, but not anymore. We will vote for anyone else, but BJP. And this is jus the beginning. We will spread the word and make sure that everyone knows the reality. 
We have travelled the world, seen the politics everywhere and know how it moves."

Desh drohi
"I know you are the most frustrated person due to BJp  Win since 2014 and trying to convey your thoughts and messages to Opposition party to make new strategies and make BJP fall and also trying to damage BJP image in public through your videos. I love to see your frustrations in video.Let BJP win in 2024 and i will see more frustration on your face in 2024 in your videos. My vote goes to BJP.  I guess your are Mamta Banerjees chota bhai, Aret you ? "
Ayega toh modi hi
Hi Hi Hi wonderful
"I am no Bhakt, but why does this channel feels like Kattar anti bjp"
Jaise ki tum Congress agent ho ...Aur Bahar sabko deshbhakt bata rahe ho
Modi will win. Proud on him
I like AAP & TMC to some extent but this regional party especially from UP & Bihar are pathetic. UP is though developing but Bihar is worst in development parameter.
"I-N-D-I-A name has announced this week, HOW YOU KNOW IT BEFORE 3 MONTHS???? You are paid organized video Creator of Opposition?"
"R u a unbiased deshbhakt or anti- bjp ??
First of all confirm ur stand."
